# web_scraping_scripts
This repo stores all my python scripts which I used to scrape data from etrain.info.in
I used these scripts to scrape the station names and codes of various stations in India.
Also I scraped their running schedule and their running history.
Still working on the running history scraping though.

# Also this is my first ever repo in GitHub!
